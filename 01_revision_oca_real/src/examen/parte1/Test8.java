//Which three are advantages of the Java exception mechanism?

//A.Improves the program structure because the error handling code is separated from the normal
//program function

//B.Provides a set of standard exceptions that covers all the possible errors

//C.Improves the program structure because the programmer can choose where to handle exceptions

//D.Improves the program structure because exceptions must be handled in the method in which they
//occurred

//E.Allows the creation of new exceptions that are tailored to the particular program being created
