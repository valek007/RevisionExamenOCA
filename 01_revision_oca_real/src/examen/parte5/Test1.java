//Given the code fragment:
//int[] array = {I, 2, 3, 4, 5};
//And given the requirements:
//Process all the elements of the array in the order of entry.
//Process all the elements of the array in the reverse order of entry.
//Process alternating elements of the array in the order of entry.
//
//
//Which two statements are true?
//		A.Requirements 1, 2, and 3 can be implemented by using the enhanced for loop.
//		B.Requirements 1, 2, and 3 can be implemented by using the standard for loop.
//		C.Requirements 2 and 3 CANNOT be implemented by using the standard for loop.
//		D.Requirement 1 can be implemented by using the enhanced for loop.
//		E.Requirement 3 CANNOT be implemented by using either the enhanced for loop or the standard for loop.
